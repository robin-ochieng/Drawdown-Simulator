# Drawdown Simulator

## Overview

The Drawdown Simulator is a Shiny application designed to help individuals make informed decisions about whether to buy an annuity or draw down their pension at retirement. In Ireland, this process is known as an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) [34]. 

## What is Drawdown?

Drawdown involves keeping oneâ€™s pension savings invested with their pension provider upon reaching retirement. Each year, the retiree decides how much money to withdraw from their pension pot to live on. The remaining pension fund stays invested, typically in the stock market.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Visualize different drawdown scenarios and their potential outcomes.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Utilize real-world data to make informed decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and understand, even for those with limited financial knowledge.
